	<h2>DESIGN</h2>
	<p>If you’re a web developer or designer who has lately working on
		projects for mobile devices, it won’t take too long before you realize
		that a pixel no longer equals a pixel.</p>
	<p>You noticed this because you looked up the screen resolution of
		the new Galaxy S6 and were puzzled as to how it could have a larger
		resolution than your 1080p widescreen desktop monitor, and yet
		websites are still perfectly readable and seem to render at the same
		size as they always have. Something is literally not adding up.</p>
	<p>For a web developer, this means that with the advent of
		high-density displays, you can’t count on a device’s screen resolution
		anymore to tell you how wide a page should be. When Apple pioneered
		this with their Retina display, they split the concept of pixels into
		hardware pixels and software pixels. A hardware pixel is an individual
		dot of light in the display. A software pixel, also called a CSS pixel
		in the web world, is a unit of measurement.</p>

			<h2>Sharper text</h2>
			<p>You’ll notice that text appears much sharper on a high-density
				display. The font size is the same relative to the rest of the page,
				but the text is drawn at the hardware pixel level. So, a font size
				of 14px will take up 14 CSS pixels but render at 28 hardware pixels.
				(The enhanced text rendering is handled automatically by the
				browser—you don’t need to do anything at all to take advantage of
				this feature.)</p>

			<h2>Sharper icons</h2>
			<p>Technically this could fall under “text”, but lately there’s
				been a movement to use icon fontssuch as FontAwesome to render icons
				instead of traditional images. The advantages include the ability to
				specify the color, size and hover effects via CSS so you don’t need
				separate images for each color variant. Essentially this is a
				creative and easy way to use vectors in web design that are sharp at
				any size, and the same high-DPI benefits apply here too. An
				icon-font icon will be sized with CSS pixels but rendered with
				hardware pixels.</p>
